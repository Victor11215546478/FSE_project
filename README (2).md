# _KDNet_
This repository contains the refactored database with an implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01222 in pytorch. 

# _Annotation_
Authors of the article above developed a new deep learning architecture for  3D model recognition tasks called Kd-network. This architecture is based on kd-trees and gives certain advantage compared to the currently dominant convolutional architectures. Authors' technique provides remarkably good perfomance on a variety of popular benchmarks
